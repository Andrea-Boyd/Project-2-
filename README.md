# QOL
USER STORY:
The goal of this project was to create a website where university students could research the cities and schools where they either are planning to attend, or already attend. 
With the form we have a created, they can add their city and comments on quality of life in these cities, and update the database.

For this project, we used:
- An Express and Node server
- Handlebars.js for the template engine
- Heroku for deployment
- Javascript, HTML, CSS for functionality

Future Development, 
- We'd like to add a system to average all the ratings and create a clean look when searching cities. 
-  We'd like a way to average all the scores given to give an overall rating out of 5 for each category
- We also would want to create a most and least helpful review rating system, to narrow down the best reviews for people researching
