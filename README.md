# QOL

The goal of this project was to create a website where university students could research the cities and schools where they either are planning to attend, or already attend. 
With the form we have a created, they can add their city and comments on quality of life in these cities, and update the database.

For this project, we used:
-An Express and Node server
-Handlebars.js for the template engine
-Heroku for deployment
-Javascript, HTML, CSS for functionality

For future development, we'd like to add a system to average all the ratings and create a clean look when searching cities.
